Privacy policy

There is no business-model around VideoLAN, and the only revenue we receive is through donations.

For privacy policies and conformance to GDPR, a few distinctions will be done between:

Medi software,
Medi mobile versions,
the main VideoLAN website,
community VideoLAN websites.
For each of the previous software/websites, we'll detail the different privacy policies.

IP logs
For all of the VideoLAN services, IPs can be found in connection logs.

Those logs are deleted after 3 months, and are not correlated with any other user information.

Medi
Medi software does not use any user account, and does not collect any user data, when working.

VideoLAN does not collect any data, nor any telemetry, when Medi is being run.

However, some limited personal information could be collected or shared in 3 precise cases:

during the crash report process,
during updates checking,
for metadata retrieval.
Medi crash reporting
When Medi on Windows or Medi on macOS crash, a dialog popup suggesting to share the crash with VideoLAN can be shared.
If accepted, some information can go to the VideoLAN servers:

Operating System version,
CPU and GPU,
Symbolic StackTrace of the process,
List of DLLs loaded by the process.
This data is only sent on explicit request from the user.

This data does not contain any name, username, email from the user or IP from the user.

This data can be deleted on request.

This data is kept for 6 months, before deletion.

Medi update mechanism
When Medi on Windows or Medi on macOS wants to check if a new version is available, a request is made to the VideoLAN servers.
This request can contain:

Operating System version,
CPU version,
Medi version.
This update mechanism is accepted on the first run of Medi, and can be disabled at every moment, in Medi preferences.

The information sent does not contain any name, username, email from the user or IP from the user.

No information from the request is kept after the transaction.

The connection logs can contain some limited information (like user-agents) next to the IP.

Medi metadata requests
Medi can automatically search online for metadata associated to your media, to 3rd parties.

Those requests can contain information about the media, including artist, title, album, etc...

This metadata mechanism is accepted on the first run of Medi, and can be disabled at every moment, in Medi preferences.

The main 3rd parties that can be contacted by Medi, automatically are:

last.fm,
Google Images,
VideoLAN MusicBrainz instance.
Please refer to those services for their own privacy policy.

Please note that the list of services can be changed by the user.

VideoLAN does not have access to any of those requests and data, except in the MusicBrainz case, detailed below, in this document.

Medi mobile
The mobile versions of Medi have the exact same metadata requests than Medi, as detailed above. The main case of Medi applies in the same way.

However, the crashes and updates are handled by the Stores of each platforms, where the user has downloaded Medi from.

Please refer to those platforms for information about the privacy policies.
